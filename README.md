The idea for the project was born from the fact that while we were searching for topic we came across a catchy line 
' Asteroid bigger than Burj khalifa to fly by Earth ' 

we thought why not research about this topic and see if it has any connections to machine learning as such 
and this is how we found out our problem statement for the project 

The problem statment being ....
what do we know about asteroid as a common person ?
nothing as such just that they are large ceslistial objects passing by in space and once in a while invading the planet.

But these asteroid are sometime are very resourceful and at the same time very dangerous ... 
But how do we know if they are resourcefull or dangerous 
well we as data scienctist cannot do that .... it is in the domain of an astrophysicist

so what can we do about these asteroids ?
well we can predict the diameter of the asteroid to know if its even worth taking a look at ....
and that is what our project is all about ....predicting the diameter of the asteroid
